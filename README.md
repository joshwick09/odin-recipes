# project-recipes

My first offical project with Odin! A basic website for recipes!

By the end of this assignment I hope to be extremely comforable with majority of the hmtl tags and git functions such as "commit", "add", etc. I feel semi-comfortable and feel like I've learned a lot so far, and am excited to continue to push forward.
