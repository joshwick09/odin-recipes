        <p class="heading">Description</p>
        <p>This is a lovely, <em>southern-style burrito</em> that brings a lot of flavor to your mouth munchies. With over 30g of protein in every portion, its a <strong>healthy and nutritious</strong> start to your day!</p>

        <p>My favorite thing about this burrito is that it works so well for meal prepping! This is my go-to when it comes to a protein heavy meal I can eat throughout the week. If you're someone who isn't a big fan of leftovers, you can always freeze these burritos, so that when you baked them they're as fresh as possible! Personally, I prepare upwards of 15-20 burritos at once then eat them over the next week or two.</p>
